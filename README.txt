These files are presented as-is. While it is still recommended that you learn how to reproduce these screens from scratch, no "start" scene has been created for you.

Notes: The "Input System" package must be added to your project for code to compile properly.
TextMeshPro will prompt you to add necessary files, some features may not behave properly until you have done so.


Suggested Extensions:
Create an engaging physics scenario utilizing player input to achieve some goal
